# Layered (N-Tier) Architecture with Dapper in .NET

- This is the most widely used architecture pattern where the application is divided into layers, each with a distinct responsibility. Common layers include- Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer, and Database Layer.

# To develop a Layered (N-Tier) Architecture using Dapper and .NET Core, we will structure the application into distinct layers, ensuring separation of concerns. The layers will be:

- Presentation Layer (Web API): Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- Application Layer: Manages the business logic and interacts with the domain and data access layers.
- Domain Layer: Defines business entities and rules.
- Infrastructure Layer (Data Access): Implements the data persistence using Dapper.

# This project Develop asp.net core .NET8 and SQL server with Dapper ORM. if you want test this project you must ensure visual studio 2022 and .NET8
